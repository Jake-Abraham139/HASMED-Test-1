A customizable, automated grading sheet generator that empowers professors to easily configure course grading layouts through a structured form—with logic-driven default behaviors, customization options, and full transparency via editable sheet settings.

## 📌 Project Overview

This tool allows instructors to:
- Select grading components (Assignments, Final Exam, Quizzes, etc.)
- Choose layout styles (single sheet or one-per-component)
- Optionally provide custom weightage
- Receive a Google Sheet generated with the selected configuration
- Fine-tune all inputs from a built-in ⚙️ Settings tab within the sheet

The system was built using **Google Forms**, **Google Apps Script**, and (optionally) form platforms like **Cognito Forms** for advanced conditional logic.
